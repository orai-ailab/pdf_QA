1. How many wells have Biostratigraphy/Biostrat report? and list all as well for me.


2. Give me the information of Middle Jurassic zonation of Biostrat report of well ''15/9-F-1''.


3. Give me all the report of Petrophysical? and summary the petrophysical result of Well named ''15/9-F-1''
-> page 9 of BIOSTRAT_REPORT_1.PDF (add image with bbox)

4. For the End of well report, Summary the Hole record of Well named 15/9-F-12?


5. I am looking Final Well Report, Can you show me the report of Well named ''15/9-F-4'' and list let me know how many BHA runs for this well?


6. For Well Test report, Please give me the Main results of Test 1 of well name ''15/19-19A"

# 1. How many wells have Biostratigraphy/Biostrat report?
- Two wells have accompanying biostrat reports. These wells are named '15/9-F-1' and '15/9-F-10'.

# 2. Summary the petrophysical result of Well named ''15/9-F-1''
- {
    "Summary 15/9- F-1": f"""Summary 15/9- F-1 
TD of 15/9 -F-1 was 3 632 m MD RKB  (Smith Bank Fm.) .  
 
The Hugin  Fm. seems to be missing, probably due to faulting.  The Volve stratigraphy  in general is 
difficult to  recognize.    
 Heather Fm. has a high net/gross ratio , N/G ~ 0.5.   
From log responses t wo intervals might contain some residual oil:  
3320.6 – 3322.5 m MD RKB  / 2991.5 –  2993.0 m TVD MSL,  
3332.4 – 3334.0  m MD RKB / 3001.2 –  3002.5 m TVD MSL.       
However no shows on cuttings are reported .  
 Skagerak Fm. seems quite  hetero geneous  with rather poor properties , the properties  are however 
slightly better in the lower part below 3450 m MD RKB.    
 LWD log data is of good quality."""

# 3. Give me the information of Middle Jurassic zonation of Biostrat report of well ''15/9-F-1''.
- See "Appendix 1. Middle Jurassic zonation" at page 10 of file "BIOSTRAT_REPORT_1.pdf" (Or show image of the report here)

# 4. I am looking Final Well Report, Can you show me the report of Well named ''15/9-F-4'' and list let me know how many BHA runs for this well?
- You can check the Final Well Report (FWR) for well '15/9-F-4' in the file "FWR_completion.pdf". This well has 18 BHA runs, including BHA NO 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 31.

# 5. For Well Test report, Please give me the Main results of Test 1 of well name ''15/19-19A"
The main objective to obtain water samples was achieved.
Due to the lack of good rate history, the data is of limited use for analysis and the result may be
interpreted in different ways.
The average permeability from the core measurements in the perforated interval is approximately
330 mD with a maximum of approximately 900 mD.
The calculated permeability from the test is approximately 13 mD which does not correspond with
the core measurements.
The core data is considered most reliable with respect tp permeability estimation in this case.
Rock mechanical properties were not obtained, due to the lack of minifiac data.
